# **Therapeutic and Research Strategies for Spike Protein-Induced BBB Disruption and Neuroimmune Dysregulation in COVID-19**

## **Structured Abstract**

**Background:** Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can lead to chronic neurological and neuroimmune sequelae, partly via the viral spike protein’s deleterious interaction with the blood–brain barrier (BBB). The spike protein triggers BBB disruption and systemic inflammation, contributing to “long COVID” cognitive impairment (brain fog), dysautonomia, and neuroimmune dysregulation ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=Vascular%20disruption%20has%20been%20implicated,a%20dampened%20adaptive%20immune%20response)) ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=in%20individuals%20with%20brain%20fog,associated%20brain%20fog)). There is an urgent need to identify therapeutic approaches that restore BBB integrity and ameliorate neuroimmune abnormalities, as well as research strategies to better understand and monitor these processes.

**Methods:** A comprehensive review of recent (2020–2024) PubMed-indexed literature was performed to identify mechanisms by which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein disrupts the BBB and induces neuroimmune dysregulation, and to evaluate potential therapeutic interventions targeting these pathways. Key areas of focus included RhoA/ROCK signaling, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), tight junction integrity, cytokine signaling, autonomic nervous system function, antiviral strategies, and neuroregenerative/metabolic support. Multidisciplinary care models and emerging research on biomarkers, imaging, autoimmunity, genetics, and syndrome comparisons were also examined.

**Results:** SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was found to increase BBB permeability by upregulating MMP-9 (degrading basement membrane collagen) and activating RhoA, causing cytoskeletal reorganization and tight junction disassembly ([

Antiviral strategies to eliminate persistent spike protein sources, and metabolic and neuroregenerative support (e.g. CoQ<sub>10</sub>, nicotinamide riboside, exercise rehabilitation) to improve mitochondrial function were also highlighted. A multidisciplinary care approach is recommended, combining neurology, cardiology, pulmonology, immunology, rehabilitation, and mental health services for comprehensive management. Key research directions include identifying biomarkers of BBB injury (e.g. neurofilament light, S100B, MMP-9), advanced neuroimaging of BBB permeability, profiling autoantibodies and T-cell responses, investigating genetic predispositions (e.g. HLA variants), and drawing parallels with similar post-infectious syndromes such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

**Conclusions:** Accumulating evidence implicates the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a long-term neurovascular and immune disruptor, driving BBB breakdown and chronic neuroinflammation in COVID-19 survivors. A multi-pronged therapeutic strategy is warranted – one that simultaneously protects or repairs the BBB, modulates aberrant immune responses, clears residual virus or spike protein, and rehabilitates autonomic and metabolic function. Given the complexity of post-COVID neuroimmune syndromes, coordinated multidisciplinary care models should be implemented. Research urgency is paramount: ongoing studies must clarify mechanisms, identify reliable biomarkers, and test targeted interventions. Framing spike-induced BBB disruption as a public health concern underscores the need for immediate intervention and cross-disciplinary coordination to prevent and treat the long-term neurological consequences of COVID-19.

## **Introduction**

Neurological complications of COVID-19, ranging from acute encephalopathy and stroke to chronic cognitive impairment, highlight the virus’s impact beyond the respiratory tract ([

A significant subset of patients experience persistent neurocognitive symptoms (“brain fog”), headaches, dysautonomia, and other signs of neuroimmune dysregulation after the acute phase – a constellation now recognized as part of long COVID or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC). Mounting evidence links these sequelae to disruption of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and sustained inflammation triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=Vascular%20disruption%20has%20been%20implicated,a%20dampened%20adaptive%20immune%20response)) ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=in%20individuals%20with%20brain%20fog,associated%20brain%20fog)). The BBB, formed by tight junction-bound endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes, is critical for maintaining the CNS immune privilege and homeostasis. Even a subtle compromise in BBB integrity can allow peripheral immune cells and cytokines to infiltrate the brain, with potential to elicit neuroinflammation, microglial activation, and neural injury.

**Spike Protein and BBB Pathophysiology:** SARS-CoV-2 can access the CNS via multiple routes, including direct viral entry across the BBB, migration along olfactory or vagal pathways, or through infected immune cells. Notably, the viral spike protein’s interaction with cells of the neurovascular unit appears to play a pivotal role in BBB disruption. In vitro and animal studies demonstrate that the isolated spike S1 subunit is sufficient to increase BBB permeability ([

The spike protein binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and other receptors (e.g. neuropilin-1) on brain endothelial cells and pericytes, triggering intracellular signals that weaken the barrier ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=infection.%20SARS,44%2C%20suggesting%20that%20other)).

Once the BBB is compromised, a feed-forward cycle of inflammation may ensue. Spike-protein-induced barrier leakage allows pro-inflammatory plasma components and leukocytes to infiltrate the CNS ([

For instance, IL-6 destabilizes endothelial junctions and can provoke coagulation, compounding vascular injury ([

Moreover, the spike protein has been shown to induce VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) release ([Blood-brain barrier function in response to SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein | Suprewicz | Neurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska](https://journals.viamedica.pl/neurologia_neurochirurgia_polska/article/view/PJNNS.a2023.0014#:~:text=metalloproteinase%209%20%28MMP,68%2C%2069%5D.%20The)), which is one of the most potent mediators of vascular permeability and could exacerbate BBB leakage. Thus, a vicious cycle emerges: spike protein -> BBB damage -> neuroinflammation -> more BBB damage.

**Clinical Implications of BBB Disruption:** The downstream effects of a leaky BBB in COVID-19 are far-reaching. Acute encephalopathy in severe COVID-19 and chronic cognitive dysfunction in long COVID have both been linked to BBB disruption on imaging and biomarker studies. A 2024 neuroimaging study by Greene *et al.* used dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to demonstrate persistent BBB permeability in patients with long COVID cognitive syndrome ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=long%20COVID%2C%20yet%20it%20is,endothelial%20cells%20in%20vitro%2C%20while)). These patients also showed abnormal blood biomarkers – notably a pro-coagulant signature and immune cell gene expression suggesting a dampened adaptive immune response ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=imaging%2C%20we%20show%20BBB%20disruption,associated%20brain%20fog)). The authors found that serum from long COVID patients could activate human brain endothelial cells in vitro, indicating circulating factors that perpetuate neurovascular inflammation ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=dysregulation%20of%20the%20coagulation%20system,associated%20brain%20fog)). In parallel, elevated plasma levels of BBB breakdown markers such as S100B, GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) have been observed in COVID-19 patients with neurological symptoms ([

Post-mortem studies have also revealed virus-related proteins persisting at the CNS borders.

Taken together, these observations underscore that spike protein-induced BBB disruption is not only an acute event but can lead to ongoing neuroimmune dysregulation, contributing to long-term neurological deficits.

Given the above, counteracting BBB disruption and neuroimmune dysregulation has become a priority in managing and researching long COVID. The following sections of this paper discuss **therapeutic interventions** aimed at stabilizing the BBB and modulating the resultant neuroimmune dysfunction, the **need for multidisciplinary care models** to address the multifaceted nature of long COVID, emerging **research directions** for deeper understanding, and a forward-looking **conclusion** calling for urgent action. By targeting the mechanistic pathways outlined – RhoA/ROCK signaling, MMP activity, tight junction integrity, cytokine cascades, autonomic imbalances, viral reservoirs, and neuro-metabolic health – we can formulate a comprehensive strategy to mitigate the spike protein’s pathogenic legacy in the nervous system.

## **Therapeutic Interventions**

Efforts to therapeutically counteract spike protein-induced BBB disruption and neuroimmune dysregulation are inherently cross-disciplinary, drawing on neurology, immunology, and vascular biology. The therapeutic strategies outlined below target different points in the cascade from BBB injury to neuroimmune activation. These include inhibiting the molecular triggers of barrier breakdown, strengthening the barrier’s structural components, damping the inflammatory response, rebalancing autonomic function, clearing residual virus, and supporting neuronal recovery. Crucially, many of these strategies may be synergistic and are likely most effective in combination.

### **Inhibition of RhoA/ROCK Pathway**

One of the most direct approaches to preserving BBB integrity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection is to inhibit the RhoA–ROCK (Rho-associated kinase) pathway. As described, spike protein-mediated activation of RhoA is a key mechanism of tight junction disruption ([

Therefore, *RhoA/ROCK inhibitors* are attractive candidates to prevent or reverse BBB leakage. In *vitro* studies have already provided proof-of-concept: treating human brain endothelial cells with a RhoA inhibitor (C3 transferase) completely abrogated spike S1-induced permeability increases ([

These data suggest that RhoA activation is necessary for spike-related barrier damage, and blocking it can “rescue” the BBB. Potential therapeutic agents include direct ROCK inhibitors (e.g. fasudil, ripasudil) and indirect RhoA pathway modulators such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which have pleiotropic endothelial-stabilizing effects. Fasudil, a ROCK inhibitor used in Asia for cerebrovascular spasm, could theoretically be repurposed to prevent BBB hyperpermeability in acute infection or long COVID. There is precedent for ROCK inhibitors mitigating vascular leak in other contexts – they improve endothelial barrier function in ischemic stroke models and acute lung injury ([SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein Disrupts Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity ...](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11481-021-10029-0#:~:text=,)) ([

By reducing endothelial contraction and junctional disintegration, these drugs confer vascular protection. In the COVID-19 context, Calò *et al.* hypothesized early on that ROCK inhibition may benefit patients by upregulating ACE2 and reducing Ang II-mediated inflammation ([

Patients with certain rare syndromes (Bartter’s/Gitelman’s) who have chronically blunted RhoA/ROCK activity showed less severe COVID-19 outcomes, indirectly supporting this strategy ([
            Rho kinase inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2 induced acute respiratory distress syndrome: Support from Bartter’s and Gitelman’s syndrome patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7217778/#:~:text=match%20at%20L189%20,3)) ([

While clinical trials are needed, RhoA/ROCK inhibition stands out as a targeted approach to maintain BBB integrity. Combining ROCK inhibitors with anti-inflammatory treatment may be especially potent: by preventing initial barrier breach, one can potentially avoid the cascade of immune cell invasion and cytokine elevation that follows. Safety and timing, however, are key considerations – these agents would ideally be deployed early (during acute infection or as prophylaxis in high-risk individuals) to preempt BBB damage, or intermittently in long COVID patients during flare-ups of neuroinflammatory symptoms.

### **Regulation of MMP Activity**

Matrix metalloproteinases, especially MMP-9, are another prime target for therapeutic intervention. Excessive MMP activity is implicated in BBB disruption not only in COVID-19 but in other neuroinflammatory conditions (e.g. multiple sclerosis, where MMPs facilitate immune cell entry into the CNS). In COVID-19, MMP-9 is significantly elevated in patients with severe disease and correlates with worse outcomes ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=match%20at%20L278%20can%20cause,24%2C25)) ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=can%20cause%20vascular%20inflammation%20and,24%2C25)). Furthermore, recent studies show that long COVID patients continue to have higher serum MMP-9 levels than healthy controls ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=match%20at%20L203%20MMP,with%20the%20flavonoids%20luteolin%20and)). The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein directly induces human microglia to release MMP-9 ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=MMP,with%20the%20flavonoids%20luteolin%20and)). This link between spike protein and MMP-9 provides a rationale to use *MMP inhibitors* or modulators to protect the BBB. While broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor drugs have historically faced challenges (due to side effects in cancer trials), certain existing medications have MMP-inhibiting properties. For instance, doxycycline at sub-antibiotic doses can inhibit MMP-9 and has been used to treat aneurysms and neuroinflammatory conditions. In the context of COVID-19, tetracyclines (minocycline, doxycycline) are intriguing because they combine MMP suppression with anti-inflammatory and microglia-calming effects. **Minocycline**, in particular, is a blood–brain-barrier-penetrant antibiotic known to dampen microglial activation and MMP secretion; it has been repurposed in trials for stroke and multiple sclerosis to reduce tissue damage. Another approach is via endogenous MMP regulators: the balance of tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) to MMPs could be shifted in favor of inhibition. Drugs that boost TIMP expression or function might indirectly quell MMP-9 activity. 

Additionally, certain nutraceutical compounds can curtail MMP release. **Luteolin**, a dietary flavonoid, was shown by Kempuraj *et al.* to significantly inhibit spike-induced MMP-9 release from microglial cells ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=MMP,with%20the%20flavonoids%20luteolin%20and)) ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=tetramethoxyluteolin%20,stimulated%20by%20the%20Spike%20protein)). In that study, pre-treatment with luteolin (and its analog methoxyluteolin) prevented the surge of MMP-9 caused by the spike protein, thereby potentially averting the downstream BBB damage ([
            Long COVID elevated MMP-9 and release from microglia by SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11472557/#:~:text=MMP,with%20the%20flavonoids%20luteolin%20and)). Luteolin is known for blood–brain barrier permeability and multiple neuroprotective properties, including mast cell stabilization and cytokine suppression, making it a promising adjunct therapy. Other flavonoids (e.g. quercetin) and polyphenols have also demonstrated MMP-inhibiting effects and could be explored as supportive therapy to reduce vascular inflammation. It is worth noting that *corticosteroids*, widely used in acute COVID-19, also reduce MMP levels and strengthen endothelial tight junctions, which may partly explain their benefit in severe cases (beyond general cytokine dampening).

In summary, controlling MMP activity – through repurposed drugs like minocycline/doxycycline, or supplements like luteolin – could help maintain the integrity of the BBB’s extracellular matrix and tight junction architecture. This strategy addresses the extracellular enzymatic assault unleashed by the spike protein. Any MMP-targeted intervention should be closely monitored via biomarker levels (e.g. serum MMP-9) and imaging of BBB permeability to gauge efficacy.

### **Tight Junction Preservation and Endothelial Stabilizers**

Restoring and preserving the structural components of the BBB is another therapeutic avenue. Here, the goal is to **enhance tight junction (TJ) integrity** or prevent their disassembly, thereby fortifying the barrier against insults. Several classes of agents can be considered “endothelial stabilizers”:

- **Angiopoietin/Tie2 pathway agonists:** Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is an endogenous ligand that strengthens endothelial junctions via the Tie2 receptor. In sepsis and acute lung injury models, Ang1 or its mimetics reduced vascular leakage. While not yet tested in COVID-19, boosting Ang1/Tie2 signaling could counteract the spike protein’s barrier-weakening effects. Conversely, blocking Angiopoietin-2 (a context-dependent antagonist of Ang1 that is elevated in ARDS) might also help, as high Ang2 is associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes and capillary leak.

- **Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) signaling:** S1P is a lipid mediator that, when bound to the S1P<sub>1</sub> receptor on endothelial cells, induces cytoskeletal rearrangement conducive to tighter junctions and reduced permeability. The drug **fingolimod** (FTY720), an S1P receptor modulator approved for multiple sclerosis, sequesters lymphocytes but also promotes endothelial barrier function. Fingolimod was noted to reduce inflammation and improve outcomes in models of viral encephalitis and was experimentally used in some severe COVID-19 cases to temper pulmonary inflammation. Although its use carries risks (immunosuppression, bradycardia), a lower-dose or selective S1P1 agonist might strengthen the BBB and suppress excessive leukocyte transmigration.

- **VE-cadherin enhancers:** Vascular endothelial cadherin is a key adhesive molecule at endothelial junctions. Stabilizing VE-cadherin interactions (through small molecules or inhibiting pathways that cause its internalization, like VEGF signaling) can maintain barrier integrity. For example, *intravenous immunoglobulin* (IVIG), besides immune modulation, has been reported to restore endothelial barrier function in certain inflammatory neuropathies by affecting cadherin and integrin signaling. IVIG’s multifaceted mechanisms (including autoantibody neutralization and Fc receptor blockade) could prove beneficial in long COVID patients with suspected autoimmune endothelial damage (discussed further below).

- **Glucocorticoids:** Steroids like *dexamethasone* not only reduce inflammatory gene expression but also upregulate some tight junction proteins and adherens junction molecules. Dexamethasone has been shown to increase occludin and claudin-5 expression in vitro, which could explain in part its efficacy in reducing cerebral edema in other diseases. In acute COVID-19, dexamethasone’s survival benefit in hypoxic patients is established; in long COVID, a short course of low-dose corticosteroids has anecdotal support for symptom flares. Care must be taken due to systemic side effects, but a tailored, short-term use might break cycles of neuroinflammation and allow BBB repair.

- **Other agents:** *ACE2 upregulators* (such as soluble ACE2 or certain recombinant ACE2 fragments) could theoretically reduce spike protein binding to endothelium and mitigate downstream BBB damage, though this approach is still experimental. *Phosphodiesterase inhibitors* (like pentoxifylline or PDE5 inhibitors) raise cAMP, which tightens junctions and was protective in some models of barrier dysfunction. *Hyperbaric oxygen therapy* has been postulated to improve long COVID neurological symptoms; one hypothesis is that it promotes angiogenesis and repair of endothelial lining in brain vasculature. 

Ultimately, tight junction enhancers would act as a protective shield. They are especially relevant for individuals already experiencing long COVID, where persistent barrier leak might be ongoing. By patching up the BBB, such treatments could limit further immune infiltration into the brain, setting the stage for recovery. It will be important to measure tight-junction protein levels (from endothelial exosomes or post-therapy lumbar puncture) and BBB permeability (via MRI or CSF:serum albumin ratio) when testing these interventions in trials.

### **Cytokine and Immune Modulators**

Neutralizing the inflammatory mediators that are elevated due to spike protein and BBB breach is a cornerstone of therapy. **Cytokine modulators** can both protect the BBB (by reducing cytokine-induced barrier opening) and quell the neuroimmune activation that results from barrier failure. Several immunomodulatory therapies have been explored in acute COVID-19 and may have roles in the chronic phase:

- **IL-6 Inhibition:** IL-6 is a central driver of the cytokine storm and is directly implicated in BBB disruption ([Blood-brain barrier function in response to SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein | Suprewicz | Neurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska](https://journals.viamedica.pl/neurologia_neurochirurgia_polska/article/view/PJNNS.a2023.0014#:~:text=metalloproteinase%209%20%28MMP,68%2C%2069%5D.%20The)). *Tocilizumab*, a monoclonal antibody against the IL-6 receptor, has been widely used in severe COVID-19 to dampen systemic inflammation. By extension, it could mitigate CNS inflammation – interestingly, one analysis noted that an open BBB in COVID-19 might allow tocilizumab to penetrate the CNS better ([
            Alteration of the blood-brain barrier by COVID-19 and its implication in the permeation of drugs into the brain - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10043238/#:~:text=passage%20of%20xenobiotics%2C%20including%20viral,with%20a%20more%20permeable%20BBB)) ([
            Alteration of the blood-brain barrier by COVID-19 and its implication in the permeation of drugs into the brain - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10043238/#:~:text=for%20P,with%20a%20more%20permeable%20BBB)), potentially helping resolve neuroinflammation. In long COVID patients with elevated IL-6 or C-reactive protein who continue to have cognitive issues, off-label tocilizumab or the IL-6 inhibitor *sarilumab* could be considered, weighing infection risk. Anecdotal reports suggest some long COVID clinics have trialed tocilizumab in select cases of refractory neuroimmune symptoms with mixed but occasionally positive results. A controlled trial would help determine efficacy.

- **IL-1 Inhibition:** IL-1β is another cytokine known to increase endothelial permeability and drive neuroinflammation. *Anakinra* (IL-1 receptor antagonist) improved outcomes in hyperinflammatory COVID-19 and has neuroprotective rationales – IL-1 can trigger microglial activation and is implicated in neurodegenerative processes. Reducing IL-1 signaling might preserve BBB function; for example, blocking IL-1 prevents ATP-mediated tight junction disruption in human BBB models ([Blood-brain barrier function in response to SARS-CoV-2 and its spike protein | Suprewicz | Neurologia i Neurochirurgia Polska](https://journals.viamedica.pl/neurologia_neurochirurgia_polska/article/view/PJNNS.a2023.0014#:~:text=Proteins%20via%20IL,brain)). In long COVID patients with signs of ongoing inflammation (e.g. elevated IL-1 or inflammasome activation markers), anakinra is an option to test, with careful monitoring.

- **TNF-α Blockade:** TNF is highly potent in promoting vascular leak and can directly cause endothelial apoptosis at high concentrations. Anti-TNF biologics (e.g. infliximab, etanercept) are standard in various autoimmune diseases. Although TNF inhibitors were not widely studied in acute COVID due to concern for infections, some case reports note their successful use in post-COVID arthritis or inflammatory syndromes. The CNS penetration of large anti-TNF antibodies is limited, but even peripheral TNF reduction could lower CNS TNF through decreased transport. A small pilot could evaluate etanercept (perhaps via intranasal route, as has been trialed in Alzheimer’s disease to directly impact the brain) for long COVID cognitive symptoms.

- **Janus Kinase (JAK) Inhibitors:** *Baricitinib*, a JAK1/2 inhibitor, gained emergency use authorization for hospitalized COVID-19 because it both lowers cytokine production and incidentally impairs viral endocytosis. JAK inhibitors cross the BBB and could reduce microglial activation by blocking interferon and other cytokine signaling inside the CNS. Baricitinib is being evaluated in long COVID trials (RECOVER) for neurocognitive symptoms. Caution is warranted due to immunosuppression, but a short course might break a cycle of inflammation. Other JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, ruxolitinib) similarly could modulate the neuroimmune milieu if needed.

- **Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG):** IVIG is a pooled antibody product that can modulate the immune system in complex ways. It is known to neutralize autoantibodies and has shown benefit in certain post-viral autoimmune neuropathies. In the context of long COVID dysautonomia (e.g. postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, POTS), IVIG is being tested for its ability to bind and remove pathogenic autoantibodies against autonomic receptors ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)) ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=%2A%20Gamunex,counteract%20excessive%20loss%20of%20fluids)). By the same token, if long COVID cognitive issues are partly autoimmune (e.g. NMDA receptor antibodies or others), IVIG could be beneficial. The NIH’s RECOVER-AUTONOMIC trial is currently testing IVIG in long COVID POTS patients ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)). Anecdotal evidence from case series indicates some long COVID patients experience improvement in fatigue and cognition after IVIG therapy, possibly through immune modulation and restoring normal cytokine networks.

- **Microglial inhibitors:** Beyond broad cytokine targeting, drugs that specifically calm overactive microglia (the brain’s resident immune cells) can help resolve neuroinflammation. *Low-dose naltrexone (LDN)* is one example being empirically used in long COVID; at doses of 1.5–4.5 mg, naltrexone paradoxically exerts anti-inflammatory effects and is thought to reduce microglial activation. LDN has a favorable safety profile and some preliminary positive reports in long COVID and related syndromes (fibromyalgia, ME/CFS). Other experimental compounds include *minocycline* (as mentioned, both an MMP and microglial inhibitor) and *ibudilast*, a small molecule that attenuates glial activation and is in trials for neuro-inflammatory conditions. 

Cytokine and immune modulators work downstream of the initial spike–BBB insult, aiming to prevent a persistent inflammatory state that could damage neurons and glia. They are especially relevant for patients already in the chronic phase, where ongoing immune dysregulation (e.g. elevated inflammatory markers, presence of autoantibodies) is detectable. The use of these therapies should be guided by biomarker profiling – for example, an individual with high IL-6 and CRP might benefit from IL-6 inhibition, whereas someone with an autoimmune phenotype might need IVIG or plasma exchange. Combination therapy is also a consideration: one could pair a cytokine blocker with an antiviral or with a BBB stabilizer for a more comprehensive approach. Tailoring treatment to the patient’s immune profile – a step toward *personalized medicine* in long COVID – will likely yield the best outcomes while minimizing unnecessary immunosuppression.

### **Autonomic Restoration Therapies**

Many long COVID patients suffer from dysautonomia, manifesting as orthostatic intolerance, tachycardia, blood pressure swings, GI dysmotility, and other symptoms of autonomic nervous system imbalance. Autonomic dysfunction can arise from vagal nerve damage, baroreflex impairment, persistent sympathetic activation, or autoantibodies to autonomic receptors – all of which have been documented post-COVID ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20two%20trials%2C%20collectively%20known,from%20sitting%20or%20lying%20down)) ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)). These symptoms not only diminish quality of life but can further exacerbate neuroimmune issues (e.g. poor cerebral perfusion from orthostatic hypotension can worsen cognitive fog, and unopposed sympathetic activity promotes inflammation). Therefore, therapies targeting autonomic restoration are a crucial component of the overall strategy.

**Conservative and Non-Pharmacologic Measures:** The foundation of dysautonomia management lies in non-drug approaches, often grouped as *physical counter-maneuvers and lifestyle modifications*. Long COVID clinics routinely advise increased hydration and salt intake to expand blood volume for orthostatic intolerance ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=,counteract%20excessive%20loss%20of%20fluids)) ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=%2A%20Coordinator,counteract%20excessive%20loss%20of%20fluids)). Patients are taught to use compression garments (compression stockings or abdominal binders) to mitigate venous pooling upon standing ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=%2A%20Gamunex,counteract%20excessive%20loss%20of%20fluids)). Elevating the head of the bed can reduce supine hypertension and improve tachycardia on waking. Graded exercise, though tricky due to post-exertional malaise (PEM) in some patients, is applied carefully in dysautonomia: recumbent exercises (rowing, swimming) are introduced before upright exercises to gradually condition the cardiovascular reflexes without exacerbating symptoms. **Physical therapy and occupational therapy** play a role in teaching pacing strategies and gentle conditioning. Additionally, some centers incorporate *mindfulness and breathing techniques*, as slow deep breathing can enhance vagal tone and stabilize heart rate and blood pressure variability ([Preliminary evaluation of a mindfulness intervention program in ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666354625000213#:~:text=Preliminary%20evaluation%20of%20a%20mindfulness,women%20with%20Long%20COVID%20dysautonomia)).

**Pharmacotherapy for Autonomic Symptoms:** When lifestyle measures are insufficient, several medications can be employed, often in combination:

- For *orthostatic tachycardia/POTS*, low-dose **beta blockers** (propranolol, bisoprolol) can reduce heart rate and ameliorate palpitations and tremulousness. Alternatively, **ivabradine**, a sinus node inhibitor that lowers heart rate without affecting blood pressure, is being trialed in long COVID POTS ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)) ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=%2A%20Gamunex,counteract%20excessive%20loss%20of%20fluids)). Ivabradine has shown promise in small case series, improving exercise tolerance and fatigue by controlling excessive heart rate. The ongoing RECOVER trial includes ivabradine as one arm for autonomic dysfunction ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)).

- For *orthostatic hypotension*, **vasoconstrictors** like midodrine (an alpha-1 agonist) can raise standing blood pressure and reduce dizziness. **Fludrocortisone**, a mineralocorticoid, helps the body retain salt and water to support blood pressure. These are standard in POTS management and are being applied to long COVID patients with significant orthostatic drops. 

- For *gastrointestinal dysautonomia* (e.g. gastroparesis, intestinal dysmotility), prokinetic agents such as low-dose erythromycin or prucalopride may be used, and dietary modifications (small frequent meals, lower fat/fiber) are advised. 

- For *sudomotor (sweating) dysfunction or small fiber neuropathy pain*, agents from neuropathic pain management (gabapentinoids, low-dose antidepressants) or IVIG (if autoimmune small fiber neuropathy is confirmed) might be indicated.

**Vagus Nerve Stimulation (VNS):** Given the vagus nerve’s crucial role in the parasympathetic system and in the inflammatory reflex (vagal modulation of cytokine production), VNS has garnered attention as a therapy to address both dysautonomia and neuroimmune dysregulation. Non-invasive *transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation* (t-VNS), which typically involves electrical stimulation at the ear’s auricular branch or the cervical vagus distribution, has shown encouraging results in pilot studies. Zheng *et al.* treated 24 female long COVID patients with 10 days of twice-daily t-VNS and observed significant improvements in cognitive function, anxiety, sleep, and fatigue scores compared to baseline ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=Conclusion)). These improvements persisted or even increased at 1-month follow-up ([

VNS likely works by enhancing parasympathetic activity (countering sympathetic overdrive) and activating the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway, thereby reducing systemic cytokine levels. It has been previously used in conditions like refractory epilepsy, depression, and inflammatory diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis via implanted devices), with evidence of lowering TNF and IL-6. For long COVID, noninvasive VNS offers a relatively low-risk intervention that can be self-administered with proper guidance. Side effects are minimal (tingling, mild bradycardia in some), and if the pilot data hold, larger controlled trials could validate its efficacy. Indeed, small trials are underway and early science media reports note reductions in hallmark symptoms (chronic fatigue, headaches) with VNS ([Zapping the Vagus Nerve Could Relieve Some Long COVID ...](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zapping-the-vagus-nerve-could-relieve-some-long-covid-symptoms/#:~:text=Zapping%20the%20Vagus%20Nerve%20Could,chronic%20fatigue%2C%20headaches%20and)) ([Vagus nerve dysfunction in the post–COVID-19 condition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X23005657#:~:text=Vagus%20nerve%20dysfunction%20in%20the,10)).

**Autoimmune Therapies for Autonomic Dysfunction:** A subset of long COVID dysautonomia appears to be immune-mediated. Researchers have detected *autoantibodies against G-protein-coupled receptors* that regulate autonomic function – for example, antibodies targeting β<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptors, M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and angiotensin II type-1 receptors (AT<sub>1</sub>) ([

These autoantibodies can chronically stimulate or block receptors, leading to symptoms like tachycardia, vasodilation or vasoconstriction, and gastrointestinal dysrhythmia. In one case-control study, long COVID patients had higher levels of autoantibodies to endothelin and adrenergic receptors than uninfected controls, and those levels correlated with reduced quality of life and daily function ([

For patients testing positive for such autoantibodies (a panel for adrenergic and muscarinic receptor autoantibodies is commercially available in some regions), immunotherapy may be considered. IVIG, as mentioned, is one approach intended to neutralize or promote clearance of pathogenic antibodies ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)). Another approach is *therapeutic plasma exchange (plasmapheresis)*, which can directly remove circulating autoantibodies. European case series of plasmapheresis in long COVID have reported improvements in POTS and cognitive symptoms, presumably by reducing autoantibody burden. An open-label study in Germany found that patients had transient symptom relief after plasmapheresis, and combining it with immunoadsorption (columns that specifically bind IgG) plus immunosuppressants yielded more sustained benefits ([Efficacy of repeated immunoadsorption in patients with post-COVID ...](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(24)00330-2/fulltext?uuid=uuid%3Afa264381-5db2-447d-87ab-4fc7bcca6ccf#:~:text=,%C2%B7%20PubMed%20%C2%B7%20Google)) ([Severity of neurological Long-COVID symptoms correlates with ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373761249_Severity_of_neurological_long-COVID_symptoms_correlates_with_increased_level_of_autoantibodies_targeting_vasoregulatory_and_autonomic_nervous_system_receptors#:~:text=Severity%20of%20neurological%20Long,syndrome%20constitutes%20a%20plethora)). These intensive therapies are not without risks or cost, so patient selection (e.g. confirmed autoimmune markers, severe refractory symptoms) is crucial.

By addressing autonomic dysfunction through the measures above, clinicians not only improve patient comfort and functionality but also potentially create a bodily environment more conducive to healing. Proper autonomic balance ensures adequate cerebral perfusion, normalizes the “fight or flight” hormones that can influence immune cells, and reduces the physiological stress that can propagate inflammation. As part of an integrative approach, autonomic restoration therapies often need to be maintained over time (months, if not longer) and adjusted as the patient’s condition evolves. Coordination between cardiologists, neurologists, and rehabilitation specialists is essential to tailor these therapies to each individual’s needs.

### **Antivirals and Viral Protein Clearance**

While the focus often lies on immune and vascular targets, it is also logical to address the root cause – the virus (or its remnants) – when attempting to reverse spike protein-induced pathology. A prevailing hypothesis for long COVID is that *persistent viral antigens* (such as spike protein or nucleocapsid fragments) remain in tissue reservoirs (e.g. lymph nodes, gut, or as noted, in meningeal regions ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=explain%20the%20neurological%20symptoms%20of,after%20infection%20in%20the%20skull))) where they continue to provoke inflammation. Hence, antiviral strategies might help by eliminating these reservoirs or halting ongoing low-level virus production that feeds spike protein into the system.

**Antiviral Therapies:** In acute COVID-19, several antivirals are effective (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir) in reducing viral load and preventing progression. In long COVID, the use of antivirals is more experimental but there is growing interest. Case reports have described patients experiencing relief of long COVID symptoms after taking *nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid)* for a re-infection or as a deliberate therapeutic trial, suggesting that active virus or viral remnants might have been driving their symptoms and were cleared by treatment. Clinical trials (such as an arm of the RECOVER initiative) are now planned or ongoing to formally test if a course of antivirals can improve post-acute symptoms. The logic is that even if replication-competent virus is not present, antivirals might reduce any residual replication in sanctuaries like the gut, or possibly accelerate the clearance of viral proteins by shutting down any lingering subgenomic RNA activity in cells.

Another antiviral approach is the use of **intranasal or inhaled interferons** in the subacute phase, which can help eradicate virus from reservoirs in the respiratory tract or olfactory epithelium (where SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found persisting for months in some individuals). By promoting an antiviral state, interferons could indirectly reduce spike antigen persistence. However, interferon in the wrong patient (those with already upregulated interferon leading to autoimmunity) could be harmful, so stratification is key.

**Spike Protein Clearance:** Apart from halting viral production, researchers are exploring ways to aid the clearance of spike protein itself from the body. One intriguing modality is *apheresis with adsorption columns* coated with ACE2 or anti-spike antibodies to specifically remove spike protein from circulation. These hemofiltration approaches have been used in Germany for acute COVID-19 cytokine storm (e.g. Cytosorb filters), and now some apheresis centers are adapting them for long COVID by using affinity columns that bind spike. While data are preliminary, some patients report improvement in brain fog after apheresis, which could correlate with removing circulating spike that might be continually triggering endothelial cells or inflammatory pathways. Monoclonal antibodies that target spike (such as those developed for COVID-19 treatment, e.g. sotrovimab) could theoretically be repurposed in an *“antigen-capture”* role if any spike antigen is present – the antibody would bind residual spike and form immune complexes that are cleared by the reticuloendothelial system, rather than letting spike freely interact with the BBB or immune cells. This approach, however, would require confirming spike presence (for example, some studies have found spike protein in the plasma of long COVID patients months after infection, detectable by ultrasensitive assays ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=Long%20COVID%3A%20Spike%20Protein%20Accumulation,term%20neurological))).

**Vaccination and Antigen Burden:** Interestingly, there is epidemiological evidence that vaccination *after* infection reduces the incidence of long COVID, which might be related to the immune system more efficiently clearing viral remnants upon recognition from vaccine-primed immunity ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=individuals%20and%20increase%20the%20risk,target%20for%20new%20therapeutic%20strategies)) ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=Intelligent%20Biotechnologies%20at%20Helmholtz%20Munich%2C,target%20for%20new%20therapeutic%20strategies)). Ertürk’s study found mRNA vaccination in mice halved the amount of spike protein accumulating in brain tissues post-infection ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=Vaccines%20Reduce%20Spike%20Protein%20Accumulation)) ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=The%20Ert%C3%BCrk%20team%20discovered%20that,point%20to%20the%20need%20for)). Though not a standalone therapy for established long COVID, this suggests that maintaining a degree of adaptive immunity against spike (through vaccines or even exposure to variants, although the latter is not advisable as a strategy) can help the body mop up residual protein. Nonetheless, vaccination is a double-edged sword for some long-haulers: while many improve, a minority report symptom flare-ups post-vaccine, possibly due to transient immune activation. This needs to be navigated on a case-by-case basis, but in general the benefit seems to outweigh the risk.

In summary, antivirals and methods to eliminate spike protein aim to **remove the inciting agent** of BBB and immune dysfunction. They strike at the heart of the problem: if successful, the inflammatory and autoimmune sequelae should gradually recede once the trigger is gone. These interventions could pair well with the other strategies (for instance, use antivirals to eliminate antigen, *and* use anti-inflammatory drugs to manage symptoms while the process resolves). More research is required to confirm persistent virus/antigen in long COVID patients and to determine which subsets will benefit most from antivirals. Tools like sensitive PCR on tissue biopsies, or PET imaging with radiolabeled probes for viral proteins, might in the future help identify “reservoir-positive” patients for targeted antiviral therapy.

### **Metabolic and Neuroregenerative Support**

The final pillar of the therapeutic strategy addresses the **downstream consequences** of the neuroimmune dysregulation – namely, neuronal, glial, and metabolic dysfunction – and attempts to promote recovery and regeneration. Long COVID patients frequently experience severe fatigue, exercise intolerance, depression/anxiety, and cognitive slowing, which in many cases parallel findings in disorders of impaired cellular energy metabolism and autonomic regulation (such as ME/CFS). Mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired neuroregeneration have been proposed as major contributors to these symptoms ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Long%20COVID%3A%20major%20findings%2C%20mechanisms,potential105%20and%20possible%20dysfunctional)) ([Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2#:~:text=Long%20COVID%20research%20has%20found,potential105%20and%20possible%20dysfunctional)). Therefore, interventions that bolster metabolic function or directly support neuronal health are considered complementary yet crucial therapy.

**Mitochondrial Support:** SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to mitochondrial damage through inflammatory oxidative stress and possibly direct viral effects on the mitochondria. Long COVID patients show evidence of bioenergetic deficits – for example, reduced mitochondrial ATP production and altered muscle metabolism on MRI spectroscopy ([Study identifies mitochondrial dysfunction as cause of long-COVID ...](https://www.news-medical.net/news/20240104/Study-identifies-mitochondrial-dysfunction-as-cause-of-long-COVID-fatigue.aspx#:~:text=Study%20identifies%20mitochondrial%20dysfunction%20as,energy%20than%20in%20healthy)). A recent comprehensive review by Molnar *et al.* highlights the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in chronic COVID sequelae and suggests therapeutic targets ([

- **Coenzyme Q<sub>10</sub>:** CoQ<sub>10</sub> is essential for electron transport chain function. Supplementation with CoQ<sub>10</sub> (or its analog ubiquinol) in patients with post-COVID fatigue has shown some improvements in energy levels in small trials. Given its low risk, a typical dose of 100–200 mg daily is often suggested to support cellular energy production ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11336094/#:~:text=energy%20metabolism%2C%20offering%20a%20promising,163%5D%2C%20nicotinamide%20riboside)).

- **Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) / NAD<sup>+</sup> boosters:** NAD<sup>+</sup> is a cofactor for metabolism and DNA repair whose levels drop with viral illness and age. NR, a form of vitamin B3, increases NAD<sup>+</sup> and has been tested in long COVID. A phase 2 trial administering 1000 mg NR twice daily for 8 weeks (with a mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant) showed trends towards improved fatigue and exercise endurance, although results are pending publication ([Mental Intervention and Nicotinamide Riboside Supplementation in ...](https://reaganudall.org/clinical-trial/mental-intervention-and-nicotinamide-riboside-supplementation-long-covid#:~:text=,with%20Long%20COVID%20compared)) ([2022-7-long-covid-clinical-trial - Massachusetts General Hospital](https://www.massgeneral.org/neurology/mccance-center/2022-7-long-covid-clinical-trial#:~:text=Steven%20Arnold%20and%20her%20collaborators,Niagen%20on%20the%20NAD%2B)). Another related compound, **niacin (vitamin B3)**, has gained anecdotal popularity among long COVID sufferers for its vasodilatory and NAD-elevating properties; some report reduced “brain fog” and muscle aches on high-dose niacin, though scientific validation is needed.

- **Alpha-Lipoic Acid (ALA):** ALA is an antioxidant that can regenerate other antioxidants and improve mitochondrial function. It’s used in diabetic neuropathy and was noted as potentially beneficial in post-COVID neuropathic symptoms. ALA might reduce oxidative damage to endothelial and neural cells, indirectly helping BBB and neurons. Doses of 600–1200 mg/day have been used in research settings ([
            Mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID: mechanisms, consequences, and potential therapeutic approaches - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11336094/#:~:text=energy%20metabolism%2C%20offering%20a%20promising,163%5D%2C%20nicotinamide%20riboside)).

- **L-Carnitine:** This amino acid derivative shuttles fatty acids into mitochondria for β-oxidation. Some long COVID patients have low carnitine levels, and supplementation could improve muscle fatigue. Acetyl-L-carnitine also has neuroprotective effects and has improved mental fatigue in other conditions like chemo-brain.

- **Dietary and Lifestyle:** A diet emphasizing mitochondrial nutrients (rich in vitamins B, C, D, iron, magnesium, etc., and polyphenols) is recommended ([
            Mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID: mechanisms, consequences, and potential therapeutic approaches - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11336094/#:~:text=therapeutic%20strategy%20for%20this%20condition,on%20a%20diet%20rich%20in)) ([

Avoiding excessive alcohol (which impairs mitochondria) and ensuring good sleep (mitochondrial repair occurs during sleep) are also counselled. Graduated exercise is itself a mitochondrial therapy – exercise is known to stimulate **mitochondrial biogenesis** via PGC-1α pathways ([
            Mitochondrial dysfunction in long COVID: mechanisms, consequences, and potential therapeutic approaches - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11336094/#:~:text=match%20at%20L832%20therapeutic%20strategy,on%20a%20diet%20rich%20in)) ([

Even if patients cannot do intensive workouts, gentle pacing and slowly increasing activity as tolerated can help rebuild aerobic capacity. 

**Neuroregenerative and Neurotrophic Therapies:** The brain has a remarkable capacity for plasticity and repair, given the right stimuli and support. Long COVID patients with cognitive impairment might benefit from interventions that enhance neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity:

- **Cognitive Rehabilitation:** Engaging in cognitive exercises (memory training, executive function tasks) through formal rehab programs or brain-training apps can drive neuroplastic changes. Many post-COVID clinics incorporate cognitive rehab therapy, which has shown benefits in post-ICU syndrome and traumatic brain injury and is likely beneficial here as well. Even simple practices like learning a new skill or language, or structured computer-based training, can promote synaptogenesis.

- **Physical Exercise (again):** Besides mitochondrial effects, exercise (especially aerobic) increases *brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)*, a key growth factor for neurons. BDNF facilitates learning, memory, and the growth of new neurons in the hippocampus. By carefully managing post-exertional malaise, long COVID patients can, over time, leverage exercise-induced BDNF to aid cognitive recovery. For those who cannot do aerobic exercise initially, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or functional electrical stimulation bikes might be used to simulate muscle activity and gain some benefits.

- **Pharmacologic Neurostimulants:** In cases of debilitating brain fog, clinicians have trialed medications like *modafinil* or *methylphenidate* to improve alertness and cognitive function. While these do not directly repair the brain, they can enhance patients’ ability to engage in therapy and exercise, indirectly supporting regeneration. Moreover, some neurostimulants have been noted to increase BDNF or other neurotrophic factors (e.g. antidepressants like SSRIs can elevate BDNF after chronic use). If a patient has comorbid depression or anxiety (common in long COVID), treating that with an SSRI/SNRI can have dual benefits for mood and possibly neuroplasticity.

- **Ketamine or NMDAR modulators:** Low-dose ketamine, now used for refractory depression and being explored for chronic fatigue, can induce synaptogenesis and is known to cause a surge in BDNF. A few clinics have started low-dose ketamine infusions for severe long COVID cases with promising anecdotal results in both mood and cognitive domains. However, rigorous data are lacking and this should be considered experimental.

- **Hormonal and Nutritional Therapies:** Ensuring adequate levels of thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, and vitamin D is important, as deficiencies can mimic or exacerbate neurocognitive issues. Some practitioners consider **melatonin** at night not only for sleep regulation but also for its neuroprotective, antioxidant properties; melatonin in high doses showed neuroprotective effects in models of brain inflammation and might help long COVID patients with sleep disturbances and neuroinflammation.

- **Stem cell or exosome therapy:** In the realm of experimental regenerative medicine, there are early discussions about mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy or exosomes derived from MSCs as treatments for diffuse neuroinflammation. MSCs have been tested in acute ARDS and have BBB-protective and immunomodulatory capabilities. For long COVID, a trial could investigate if MSC infusions lead to symptom improvement, though the cost and complexity are high, and risks like clotting must be managed. 

The principle of metabolic and regenerative support is to create an internal environment that favors healing – reducing oxidative stress, providing abundant cellular fuel and substrates for repair, and stimulating the natural pathways of recovery. Patients often report incremental gains with such supportive therapies: for instance, a slight improvement in the “energy envelope” or the ability to take on mental tasks a bit longer than before. These interventions likely need to be sustained over long periods (many weeks to months) to yield noticeable structural improvements, akin to how cardiac rehab requires months to improve heart function after myocardial injury.

In practice, a combination of a *mitochondrial cocktail* (CoQ<sub>10</sub>, NR, ALA, vitamins), personalized exercise regimen, and cognitive rehab may be instituted for a long COVID patient with fatigue and brain fog, alongside any needed medications for symptom control. Close monitoring of markers like lactate (for mitochondrial function), neurofilament (for neural damage), or cognitive testing scores can guide adjustments to this supportive care.

## **Multidisciplinary Clinical Care Models**

The diverse symptomatology and organ system involvement in long COVID make it abundantly clear that no single specialty can adequately manage these patients. Instead, a **multidisciplinary clinical care model** is required – one that integrates expertise across various fields and centers the patient’s complex needs. Such models have begun to emerge in the form of dedicated “Long COVID clinics” or comprehensive COVID centers, and they provide a template for optimal care.

**Rationale for Integrated Care:** Long COVID spans pulmonary (e.g. fibrosis, dyspnea), cardiologic (postural tachycardia, chest pain), neurologic (cognitive impairment, headaches, neuropathies), psychiatric (anxiety, depression, PTSD), rheumatologic (joint pain, autoimmune phenomena), and other domains. Traditional siloed care might address one symptom at a time, potentially overlooking interactions (for example, how orthostatic intolerance can cause cognitive problems, or how unrefreshing sleep can worsen pain and fatigue). In an integrated model, all these aspects are evaluated in concert. A recent Delphi consensus in the UK strongly endorsed integrated care for long COVID, emphasizing resource allocation for multidisciplinary teams, easy access to diverse treatments, personalized diagnostic workups, and coordination between primary care and specialists including mental health ([Integrated care policy recommendations for complex multisystem long term conditions and long COVID | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64060-1#:~:text=The%20importance%20of%20integrated%20care,participants%20and%20were%20supported%20by)) ([Integrated care policy recommendations for complex multisystem long term conditions and long COVID | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64060-1#:~:text=patients%2C%20health%20care%20professionals%2C%20and,Long%20COVID%20at%20international%20level)). The consensus recommended structured consultation across specialties and proposed models where a core team orchestrates individualized care plans ([Integrated care policy recommendations for complex multisystem long term conditions and long COVID | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64060-1#:~:text=and%20found%20similar%20integrated%20care,primary%20and%20specialist%20care%20settings)) ([Integrated care policy recommendations for complex multisystem long term conditions and long COVID | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64060-1#:~:text=enable%20structural%20consultation%20between%20primary,Long%20COVID%20at%20international%20level)).

**Examples of Multidisciplinary Clinics:** The Comprehensive COVID-19 Center (CCC) at Northwestern Memorial Hospital (Chicago, USA) provides a glimpse into the needs and utilization patterns of long COVID patients. In a cohort of ~1,800 patients seen 8 months post-infection, nearly half of initial visits were with neurology, a quarter with pulmonology, and others with cardiology, physiatry, etc., often requiring multiple specialists ([
            Multidisciplinary Center Care for Long COVID Syndrome – a Retrospective Cohort Study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10200714/#:~:text=We%20evaluated%201802%20patients%20a,hospitalized)) ([
            Multidisciplinary Center Care for Long COVID Syndrome – a Retrospective Cohort Study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10200714/#:~:text=Conclusions)). Objective testing in that cohort revealed high rates of cognitive impairment (51% of those tested), pulmonary function abnormalities (45%), and autonomic issues (12% had objective tachycardia on monitoring) ([
            Multidisciplinary Center Care for Long COVID Syndrome – a Retrospective Cohort Study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10200714/#:~:text=We%20evaluated%201802%20patients%20a,hospitalized)). These findings underscore that an **interdisciplinary approach** – with neurologists, pulmonologists, cardiologists, rehabilitation physicians, and others working together – is not just ideal but necessary. Similarly, post-COVID clinics in the UK’s National Health Service often involve an initial multi-specialty assessment (sometimes a joint clinic with, say, a respiratory physician and a neurologist) to formulate a comprehensive plan.

Key components of successful multidisciplinary care models include:

- **Care Coordination:** A designated care coordinator (often a nurse or physician assistant) can help navigate the patient through various appointments and ensure communication between specialists. In fact, one arm of the RECOVER-AUTONOMIC trial is testing a “coordinator-guided, non-drug care” intervention where patients receive weekly calls to implement lifestyle measures like salt intake and compression therapy ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)) ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=%2A%20Coordinator,counteract%20excessive%20loss%20of%20fluids)). This recognizes that guidance and follow-up are critical for adhering to non-pharmacologic regimens.

- **Lead Provider or Team:** Patients benefit from having a “medical home” for their long COVID care – a lead clinician or team that synthesizes input from consultants and monitors overall progress. This is often a primary care physician with interest in long COVID or a specialist (e.g. an infectious disease or rehabilitation medicine physician) who takes on the coordinator role. Regular team meetings (e.g. a case conference with pulmonology, cardiology, neurology, psychiatry) can be instituted for complex cases to adjust plans collaboratively.

- **Integrated Rehabilitation Services:** Physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech and cognitive therapy, and psychological counseling should be embedded in the care model. For instance, the clinic may have physiatrists (rehabilitation doctors) who coordinate with physical therapists to tailor exercise programs mindful of post-exertional malaise, or neuropsychologists who coordinate cognitive rehab for brain fog. A truly integrative program might resemble traumatic brain injury rehab, which is multidisciplinary by nature.

- **Mental Health Integration:** Addressing mental health is paramount – not only because of the psychiatric manifestations of long COVID, but also because psychological support can improve adherence and coping. Many patients feel anxious or demoralized by the array of symptoms; having mental health professionals (psychologist, psychiatrist) as part of the team normalizes these issues and provides crucial interventions (therapy, medications for mood or sleep) that can enhance overall outcomes. As the UK consensus pointed out, bridging physical and mental health care is essential ([Integrated care policy recommendations for complex multisystem long term conditions and long COVID | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-64060-1#:~:text=patients%2C%20health%20care%20professionals%2C%20and,conditions%20and%20Long%20COVID%20at)).

- **Social Services and Advocacy:** Long COVID often impacts patients’ ability to work or perform daily activities. Social workers or case managers in the clinic can assist with disability documentation, workplace accommodations, and connecting patients to community resources or support groups. Health policy advocates are also needed to address the broader issues – ensuring insurance coverage for long COVID treatments, advocating for research funding, and educating employers and schools about the condition.

**Patient-centric and Personalized Care:** Multidisciplinary care should not lead to a disjointed experience for the patient, but rather a cohesive plan that aligns with patient goals. Some clinics implement a *single-visit multidisciplinary assessment*, where in one extended session the patient might see multiple specialists who then huddle and deliver a unified set of recommendations. Others use sequential visits but unify the plan through the lead provider. It’s important to acknowledge that long COVID presentations vary; some patients might primarily have pulmonary issues, others mostly neurological. Thus, the composition of the team and intensity of involvement of each specialty should be customized. A patient with predominant neurocognitive issues and dysautonomia might need more neurology and cardiology input, whereas another with interstitial lung abnormalities and kidney injury post-COVID would need pulmonology and nephrology. 

The need for integrated care has been recognized at national levels: The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) launched a Long COVID Care Network, funding multidisciplinary clinics to expand access ([AHRQ Long COVID Care Network | Agency for Healthcare Research ...](https://www.ahrq.gov/coronavirus/long-covid/care-network.html#:~:text=,COVID%20clinics%20across%20the%20country)) ([AHRQ's Unique Effort to Advance Care for People Living with Long ...](https://www.ahrq.gov/news/blog/ahrqviews/long-covid-care-network.html#:~:text=AHRQ%27s%20Unique%20Effort%20to%20Advance,expand%20access%20to%20comprehensive%20care)). These efforts aim to create learning health systems where data from integrated care is fed back into research.

**Communication and Education:** Multidisciplinary care models also serve as a hub for patient and provider education. Patients can benefit from workshops or group visits (e.g. a session on energy conservation strategies run by an occupational therapist, or a relaxation techniques class by a psychologist). Providers across specialties learn from each other; for example, a pulmonologist becomes more aware of screening for cognitive issues, and a neurologist becomes attuned to subtle pulmonary dysfunction signs. In effect, the clinic becomes an incubator for best practices and training the next generation of clinicians in holistic care.

In conclusion, multidisciplinary care is not a luxury but a necessity for long COVID. It operationalizes the principle that “treating the whole patient” is the only way to make meaningful improvements in a syndrome that defies traditional organ-specific categorization. As we implement the therapeutic strategies discussed earlier, having them delivered in an integrated model amplifies their effectiveness – for instance, combining pharmacologic treatment with rehab and psychosocial support yields better function than either alone. Such models also facilitate research (with diverse specialists contributing observations) and ensure that breakthroughs in understanding are rapidly translated to patient care in a coordinated fashion.

## **Research Directions**

While clinicians proceed with pragmatic treatments and care models, the scientific community faces critical knowledge gaps about spike protein-induced BBB disruption and long-term neuroimmune dysregulation. Addressing these gaps through targeted research will refine therapies and may uncover new interventions. Key research directions include the identification of biomarkers, advanced imaging techniques, characterization of autoimmunity, genetic susceptibility studies, and comparative analyses with related syndromes.

### **Biomarker Identification and Monitoring**

**Why biomarkers?** Biomarkers are objective measures that can indicate the presence or extent of pathology. For BBB disruption and neuroimmune dysregulation, good biomarkers would allow noninvasive diagnosis, risk stratification, and tracking of response to therapy. They are especially needed in long COVID, where standard diagnostic tests often appear normal despite debilitating symptoms.

**Potential Biomarkers of BBB Integrity:** Markers of BBB breakdown measured in blood or CSF are actively being studied. Some candidates include:

- **S100B:** A protein produced by astrocytes, S100B is normally retained in the CNS by an intact BBB. Elevated serum S100B indicates leakage (it is used in TBI as a marker of brain injury). COVID-19 patients have shown spikes in S100B correlating with neurologic symptoms, making it a candidate to monitor barrier integrity in long COVID.

- **Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP):** GFAP is an astrocyte cytoskeletal protein. Blood GFAP is elevated in acute COVID-19, especially in those with encephalopathy, and tends to normalize after recovery in many. Persistently elevated GFAP in a long COVID patient might suggest ongoing astrocytic injury or BBB permeability. New ultrasensitive assays (e.g. single-molecule array, Simoa) can detect GFAP in serum at low levels.

- **Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL):** NfL is a marker of axonal damage and is not specific to BBB, but in context it can gauge CNS injury over time ([
            Neuro-Axonal Damage and Alteration of Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity in COVID-19 Patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9406414/#:~:text=patients%20without%20severe%20neurological%20symptoms,detection%20was%20not%20associated%20to)) ([
            Neuro-Axonal Damage and Alteration of Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity in COVID-19 Patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9406414/#:~:text=Overall%2C%20COVID,still%20detectable%20after%20discharge%20in)). In long COVID patients with cognitive issues, elevated NfL might indicate active neurodegeneration or a smoldering process facilitated by BBB breach. Zingaropoli *et al.* found plasma NfL remained elevated even months after severe COVID, implying ongoing neural injury ([
            Neuro-Axonal Damage and Alteration of Blood–Brain Barrier Integrity in COVID-19 Patients - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9406414/#:~:text=after%20recovery%2C%20comparing%20the%20obtained,ARDS%20could%20be%20associated%20to)). NfL can be tracked longitudinally; if a therapy is working, one might see NfL levels decline as the CNS environment stabilizes.

- **Cytokines and Chemokines:** A panel of inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1RA, TNF, interferon-gamma, IP-10, etc.) can characterize the systemic inflammation state. In long COVID, a “cytokine fingerprint” might differentiate subsets – e.g. one study found long COVID patients have an immune profile distinct from healthy controls, with certain chemokines elevated. Reductions in these markers could be used to confirm the efficacy of immunomodulatory treatments. Additionally, high levels of TNF or IL-6 in a patient could direct one to use specific cytokine inhibitors as therapy (precision medicine approach).

- **Markers of Coagulation and Endothelial Dysfunction:** COVID-19 is a thromboinflammatory disease; *D-dimer*, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) are often elevated acutely. Some long COVID patients have persistent coagulation activation (“microclot” hypothesis). Monitoring D-dimer or vWF could reflect ongoing endothelial perturbation. Soluble thrombomodulin or VCAM-1 are other markers indicating endothelial cell activation/damage.

- **Exosomes as surrogates:** There is burgeoning research on extracting endothelial cell–derived exosomes from the blood and measuring their cargo (like tight junction proteins or inflammatory mediators). If BBB-endothelial exosomes contain lower levels of TJ proteins (ZO-1, claudin-5) or higher inflammatory signals in long COVID patients vs controls, they could serve as a “liquid biopsy” of the BBB’s status.

**Biomarkers of Neuroimmune Dysregulation:** Beyond barrier integrity, identifying markers of immune dysregulation in the CNS is challenging (since direct brain sampling is invasive). However, one could use CSF analysis in research studies of long COVID patients who consent to lumbar puncture. A CSF profile showing elevated protein, presence of autoantibodies, or specific cytokine patterns would confirm central neuroinflammation. For less invasive means, *ophthalmologic biomarkers* might be telling – the retina is an extension of the CNS and can be imaged noninvasively. One study noted reduced retinal capillary density in long COVID patients, paralleling cerebral microvascular impairment ([Non-Hospitalized Long COVID Patients Exhibit Reduced Retinal ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2313-433X/11/2/62#:~:text=Non,exhibiting%20persistent%20neurologic%20symptoms)) ([Neurologic Manifestations of Long COVID Disproportionately Affect ...](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.27128#:~:text=Neurologic%20Manifestations%20of%20Long%20COVID,Chicago%2C%20Illinois%2C%20and%20undertook)). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) could track retinal nerve fiber layer thickness or vessel density as proxy indicators of CNS microvascular health.

Large cohort studies (like NIH RECOVER) are currently collecting blood from long COVID participants with deep phenotyping. These will be mined for biomarker differences. For example, if a subset with predominant cognitive issues shows high IL-8 and low cortisol (indicative of HPA axis dysregulation) vs a subset with POTS showing high autoantibodies to adrenergic receptors and high norepinephrine levels, it could lead to more tailored treatments for each subgroup. Biomarkers thus help parse the heterogeneity of long COVID.

Lastly, **biomarkers of treatment response** need development. In trials of drugs aiming to repair the BBB (like ROCK inhibitors or MMP inhibitors), it will be valuable to see changes in things like S100B or MMP-9 levels. For therapies like vagus nerve stimulation, measuring inflammatory markers pre- and post-intervention can objectively show if the therapy is reducing systemic inflammation as hypothesized.

### **Advanced Neuroimaging**

Neuroimaging has a critical role in visualizing BBB disruption and neuroinflammation, and it stands as both a diagnostic tool and a research instrument. Traditional MRI sequences in long COVID patients often appear normal, but specialized techniques are revealing subtle pathology:

- **Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI):** As used by Greene *et al.*, DCE-MRI can quantify BBB permeability by tracking contrast leakage over time ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=long%20COVID%2C%20yet%20it%20is,endothelial%20cells%20in%20vitro%2C%20while)) ([Blood–brain barrier disruption and sustained systemic inflammation in individuals with long COVID-associated cognitive impairment | Nature Neuroscience](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-024-01576-9#:~:text=dysregulation%20of%20the%20coagulation%20system,associated%20brain%20fog)). Long COVID patients with cognitive complaints showed increased BBB permeability in certain brain regions (e.g. frontal lobes) compared to controls. Implementing DCE-MRI in larger studies could identify a neuroimaging signature of long COVID brain fog. It could also be used in trials to see if treatments (like an anti-inflammatory drug) lead to normalization of BBB permeability values.

- **Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) MRI:** This technique measures cerebral blood flow without contrast. Some long COVID patients exhibit cerebral hypoperfusion on ASL, which might correlate with cognitive symptoms. For example, reduced perfusion in the cingulate and frontal lobes has been reported, similar to patterns seen in ME/CFS. While not a direct BBB measure, perfusion abnormalities might result from dysautonomia or microvascular dysfunction due to endothelial changes.

- **Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI):** DTI can detect microstructural changes in white matter. COVID survivors (especially after ICU delirium) sometimes have DTI evidence of white matter tract disruption. Long COVID patients with “brain fog” might show slight increases in mean diffusivity or decreases in fractional anisotropy in areas like the corona radiata or corpus callosum, suggesting neuroinflammation or axonal injury. DTI might track recovery or progression of these changes over time or with therapy.

- **MRS (Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy):** MRS can noninvasively measure brain metabolites. An MRS study found elevated *lactate* (a marker of abnormal metabolism) and *glutamate* (an excitatory neurotransmitter that in excess indicates neurotoxicity) in the brains of long COVID and ME/CFS patients ([Imbalanced Brain Neurochemicals in Long COVID and ME/CFS](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(24)00216-X/fulltext#:~:text=Imbalanced%20Brain%20Neurochemicals%20in%20Long,aspartate%20levels%20in)) ([Imbalanced Brain Neurochemicals in Long COVID and ME/CFS](https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(24)00216-X/fulltext#:~:text=People%20with%20long%20COVID%20and,aspartate%20levels%20in)). Elevated lactate in cerebrospinal fluid or certain brain regions implies mitochondrial dysfunction or hypoperfusion. Following MRS markers, one could evaluate whether mitochondrial-targeted treatments are improving central metabolism (e.g. decreasing lactate peaks).

- **PET imaging:** PET scans can use various tracers to investigate neuroimmune status:
  - *FDG-PET (fluorodeoxyglucose)* looks at glucose uptake. Some long COVID patients have regionally decreased FDG uptake (hypometabolism), particularly in frontal and cerebellar areas, correlating with cognitive and memory complaints. This pattern is reminiscent of encephalitis or neurodegenerative conditions and supports that there is an organic brain dysfunction. 
  - *Neuroinflammation PET tracers:* e.g. [^11C]PK11195 binds to TSPO, a protein upregulated in activated microglia. Using such tracers, one could potentially see if long COVID patients have increased microglial activation in brain regions (early studies in post-COVID patients are being planned or underway). If a therapy is working, we might see a reduction in PET signal.
  - *Amyloid or tau PET:* Speculative, but since severe COVID is associated with increases in blood biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (like phosphorylated tau), PET could check if long COVID is accelerating deposition of neurodegenerative proteins. One fear is that long COVID brain inflammation might predispose patients to earlier onset of neurodegenerative diseases (akin to how traumatic brain injury increases dementia risk). Long-term cohort imaging could address this.

- **Autonomic Imaging:** Tests like *metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) cardiac scintigraphy* measure sympathetic innervation of the heart. In conditions like POTS, this can sometimes be abnormal. Such imaging might confirm dysautonomia in long COVID objectively. Additionally, functional MRI or PET during autonomic maneuvers could study the central autonomic network (brainstem, insula, etc.) to see if their activation or connectivity is impaired.

Cutting-edge imaging can also be applied to the **periphery**: for example, **ultrasound of the carotid arteries** with dynamic angle measurements can assess baroreceptor sensitivity (important for blood pressure control). If baroreflex is blunted post-COVID, that might explain orthostatic tachycardia and could be a target for retraining via biofeedback.

In research, combining imaging with other data is key. For instance, correlating MRI permeability indices with blood biomarkers (like a patient with high DCE-MRI leakage also has high S100B and NfL) strengthens the evidence of BBB disruption. Imaging can also help with **phenotyping**: maybe those with brainstem diencephalon hypoperfusion on PET are the ones with more fatigue and temperature dysregulation, indicating hypothalamic involvement.

Finally, imaging gives patients validation – seeing objective changes often helps patients in believing their illness is real (which is unfortunately necessary for some who feel dismissed). It can also motivate both patient and provider to pursue appropriate aggressive treatments if you visually confirm pathology.

### **Autoimmunity and Neuroimmune Profiling**

The intersection of viral infection and autoimmunity is a major theme in post-COVID research. Many of the chronic manifestations may be immune-mediated, either through autoantibodies, persistent antigen driving T-cell responses, or aberrant immune cell phenotypes (e.g. exhausted or senescent cells). Comprehensive **autoimmune profiling** in long COVID is a priority:

- **Autoantibody Surveys:** Using high-throughput techniques like protein microarrays, researchers have identified a wide array of autoantibodies in COVID-19 survivors ([
            A causal link between autoantibodies and neurological symptoms in long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213106/#:~:text=,from%20these%20individuals%20reacted%20with)) ([
            A causal link between autoantibodies and neurological symptoms in long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213106/#:~:text=that%20correlated%20with%20their%20symptoms,from%20these%20individuals%20reacted%20with)). One study found autoantibodies against a variety of extracellular and even intracellular antigens were elevated post-infection – notably, antibodies to neuronal and glial proteins correlated with neurocognitive symptoms ([
            A causal link between autoantibodies and neurological symptoms in long COVID - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213106/#:~:text=,from%20these%20individuals%20reacted%20with)). Key autoantibodies under investigation include those against:
  - Autonomic receptors (as discussed, anti-β<sub>2</sub>AR, anti-M<sub>3</sub>R, etc.), which correlate with dysautonomia severity ([Autoantibodies in COVID-19 survivors with post-COVID symptoms](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1428645/full#:~:text=symptoms%20www,autrev)) ([Severity of neurological Long-COVID symptoms correlates with ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373761249_Severity_of_neurological_long-COVID_symptoms_correlates_with_increased_level_of_autoantibodies_targeting_vasoregulatory_and_autonomic_nervous_system_receptors#:~:text=Severity%20of%20neurological%20Long,syndrome%20constitutes%20a%20plethora)).
  - Endothelial proteins (e.g. anti-ACE2 antibodies: some patients produce antibodies against their own ACE2, potentially blocking it or causing immune complexes).
  - Myelin basic protein or other neural antigens (which could indicate a tendency toward demyelinating processes or encephalitis-like syndromes).
  - Phospholipid antibodies: transient antiphospholipid antibodies are common in acute COVID-19. Persistent ones might contribute to coagulopathy in long COVID.
  - Nuclear antigens: ANA (antinuclear antibody) titers can turn positive after COVID-19. Some patients meet criteria for lupus or Sjögren’s-like syndromes post-infection. Long COVID patients should be screened for new-onset rheumatologic disease (e.g., some develop connective tissue disease months later, raising question of virus as trigger).

  Advanced assays, like *phage display libraries*, can profile antibody repertoires against tens of thousands of antigens. One such approach identified that long COVID patients had distinct autoantibody patterns from controls, with some novel specificities implicated ([A causal link between autoantibodies and neurological symptoms in ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11213106/#:~:text=,we%20identified%20diverse%20AAB)). 

- **T Cell Phenotyping:** The cellular immune response may also be dysregulated long-term. Studies have found that long COVID patients often have *lower levels of certain naive or cytotoxic T cells* and an *elevated proportion of exhausted T cells*, as if their immune system is in overdrive and burning out. Detailed flow cytometry can reveal expansions of particular T-cell clones (suggesting antigen persistence). There is also interest in *T-cell reactivity to self-antigens* – for instance, one could test patient T cells against neural antigens to see if there’s an autoimmune T-cell response (which is harder to measure than autoantibodies). The balance of T helper subsets (Th1, Th2, Th17, Treg) in long COVID could explain why some patients experience autoimmune phenomena (Th17 skew) versus others more chronic infections (if T cell exhaustion predominates). Therapeutically, if one finds, say, deficient T regulatory cells, approaches to boost Tregs (like low-dose IL-2 therapy) might be entertained.

- **B Cell Repertoires:** Similarly, examining B cell subsets (memory B cells, double-negative B cells often expanded in autoimmune disease) can provide clues. Ongoing antigen drive often keeps germinal center reactions active, so one might detect unusual B cell phenotypes in long COVID lymph nodes or blood. Some studies found *persistently activated B cells with plasmablast features* in long COVID, which could be pumping out those autoantibodies. 

- **Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Studies:** In patients with prominent neurological symptoms and if ethically allowable, CSF analysis is incredibly informative. A subset of long COVID patients who underwent CSF evaluation have shown abnormalities such as the presence of *oligoclonal bands (OCBs)* (which are bands of IgG unique to CSF, often seen in multiple sclerosis and indicating intrathecal antibody production). While one small series of long COVID neurocognitive patients had normal CSF including no OCBs, another detected elevated IgG index and OCBs in some, implying a central autoimmune response in those individuals. If OCBs are present, the specific antigen targets can be investigated (e.g. via mass spectrometry of the bands). Even without OCBs, comparing CSF vs serum antibody profiles could highlight neuro-specific autoantibodies (antibodies that may be diluted in serum but concentrated in CSF).

Autoimmunity profiling not only provides mechanistic insight but also opens up **treatment options**: if a patient has clear evidence of autoimmunity, one might escalate immunotherapy (like we see in autoimmune encephalitis or Guillain-Barré syndrome). There is precedent: some long COVID patients were diagnosed with conditions like *autoimmune encephalitis* (e.g. NMDA receptor antibodies causing brain fog and mood changes) or *orthostatic hypotension from ganglionic AChR antibodies*, and they responded to IVIG or corticosteroids akin to how primary autoimmune diseases would.

Additionally, long COVID research should explore if there are **common autoimmune targets among patients** – if many patients share an autoantibody (like, hypothetically, against a certain brain protein), that could even be developed into a diagnostic test. It could also tie into the concept of molecular mimicry: identifying a specific human protein that shares sequence or structural similarity with part of the spike protein could explain how the autoimmunity was triggered (e.g. some have speculated that regions of spike mimic constituents of the autonomic nervous system, hence those autoantibodies).

### **Genetic Predisposition and Personalized Risk**

Not everyone who gets COVID-19 develops long-term problems, suggesting host genetics play a role in susceptibility to spike-induced neuroimmune changes. Large-scale genomic studies (GWAS) and candidate gene analyses are underway:

- **HLA Associations:** The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes strongly influence immune responses and autoimmunity. Certain alleles may predispose to or protect against long COVID. For example, one study found HLA-A*11:01 and HLA-C*07 were more frequent in long COVID patients than in uninfected controls, and were associated with increased risk of long COVID (OR ~2.3) ([
            The demographic, laboratory and genetic factors associated with long Covid-19 syndrome: a case–control study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794331/#:~:text=frequencies%20of%20the%20HLA,as%20well%20as%20a%20positive)) ([
            The demographic, laboratory and genetic factors associated with long Covid-19 syndrome: a case–control study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794331/#:~:text=1.56%E2%80%9314.44%5D.%20Similarly%2C%20both%20the%20HLA,CI%3A%200.01%E2%80%930.60)). Conversely, HLA-C*08 and HLA-A*32 appeared underrepresented in long COVID, suggesting a protective effect ([
            The demographic, laboratory and genetic factors associated with long Covid-19 syndrome: a case–control study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794331/#:~:text=presented%20in%20Table%C2%A02.%20The%20HLA,0.05)) ([
            The demographic, laboratory and genetic factors associated with long Covid-19 syndrome: a case–control study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794331/#:~:text=1.56%E2%80%9314.44%5D.%20Similarly%2C%20both%20the%20HLA,CI%3A%200.01%E2%80%930.60)). Another group reported that HLA-A*03 might confer protection – possibly due to more efficient CD8+ T cell clearance of the virus ([HLA-A*03 may confer protection against long COVID through an ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666991925000363#:~:text=,T%20cells%20and%20NK%20cells)). These findings need replication, but HLA genotyping could eventually help identify individuals at high risk for post-COVID complications. It also provides mechanistic clues: e.g. HLA-A*11 and -B*51 are known to poorly present certain SARS-CoV-2 epitopes ([
            The demographic, laboratory and genetic factors associated with long Covid-19 syndrome: a case–control study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794331/#:~:text=HLA,A%2A32)), potentially leading to inadequate viral clearance but heightened inflammation, whereas HLA-A*03 might present a crucial epitope that leads to robust early T cell responses that prevent chronic antigenemia.

- **Other Immune Genes:** Beyond HLA, genes involved in interferon responses (such as those mutated in some people who get severe COVID) might influence long COVID risk. If someone had an inborn error of interferon immunity, they might get a high viral load and more tissue damage, potentially more long-term issues. There is also interest in genes like *FCER2* (CD23, related to IgE regulation) which popped up in one combinatorial analysis of long COVID fatigue phenotype ([
            Genetic risk factors for severe and fatigue dominant long COVID and commonalities with ME/CFS identified by combinatorial analysis - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10621206/#:~:text=Combinatorial%20analysis%20identified%2073%20genes,with%20neurological%20and%20cardiometabolic%20diseases)), and genes tied to **mitochondrial function** (since mitochondrial DNA haplotypes can affect fatigue and recovery).

- **Apolipoprotein E (APOE):** The APOE4 allele, known risk factor for Alzheimer’s, was found to be a risk factor for severe COVID. It would be worthwhile to see if APOE4 carriers are more likely to get long COVID cognitive issues – perhaps due to less efficient repair mechanisms in the brain or a propensity for neuroinflammation.

- **ACE2 and TMPRSS2 Polymorphisms:** Variations in the virus entry receptors might influence how much virus enters endothelium or other tissues. Some polymorphisms in ACE2 increase its expression; while that might protect lungs (by metabolizing angiotensin II), it could increase spike protein docking sites on endothelium, hypothetically facilitating BBB involvement. This remains speculative but testable.

- **Gender and Genetic Factors:** Long COVID appears to affect women disproportionately (some surveys report ~60–70% of long-haulers are female) ([
            Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation improves Long COVID symptoms in a female cohort: a pilot study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=Long%20COVID%2C%20also%20known%20as,19%20conditions)) ([
            Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation improves Long COVID symptoms in a female cohort: a pilot study - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11097097/#:~:text=multisystemic%20symptoms%20that%20persists%20for,19%20conditions)). Part of this could be genetics (X-chromosome immunomodulatory genes, hormonal factors). Genes like *TLR7* (toll-like receptor 7 on the X chromosome, relevant to viral RNA recognition) might contribute, as loss-of-function TLR7 mutations cause severe COVID in young men. Meanwhile, women’s tendency for autoimmunity might come into play. Investigating epigenetic changes (like methylation differences in immune cell genes post-infection) is also important.

The aim of genetic studies is to identify those who might need closer monitoring after COVID-19. For example, if someone has an HLA allele associated with poor viral clearance and an autoimmune tendency, one might prophylactically follow their biomarkers or even intervene early post-infection (perhaps giving a course of anti-inflammatory therapy or antiviral therapy to reduce long-term risk). Genetics can also point to molecular pathways that are druggable. If a GWAS finds that variants in a certain chemokine receptor gene track with neuroPASC, maybe blocking that receptor could help.

### **Syndrome Comparisons and Cross-Disciplinary Insights**

An illuminating approach in research is to compare long COVID with other syndromes that have overlapping clinical or biological features. This can leverage decades of research in those fields to jump-start understanding of long COVID, and conversely, studying long COVID can shed light on those conditions:

- **Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS):** The parallels between long COVID and ME/CFS (often post-viral in origin) are striking ([
            ME/CFS and Long COVID share similar symptoms and biological abnormalities: road map to the literature - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10278546/#:~:text=similar%20to%20myalgic%20encephalomyelitis%2Fchronic%20fatigue,This%20comparison)) ([
            ME/CFS and Long COVID share similar symptoms and biological abnormalities: road map to the literature - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10278546/#:~:text=Shortly%20after%20the%20onset%20of,acute%20SARS)). Both involve post-exertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, unrefreshing sleep, and autonomic disturbances. Research is now actively comparing these groups. Early findings indicate similar profiles in cardiopulmonary exercise tests (e.g. both may show an abnormal drop in peak oxygen consumption on day 2 of a 2-day exercise test, reflecting impaired recovery). Neuroimaging comparisons find that ME/CFS and long COVID patients share patterns of brain hypometabolism and autonomic brain network impairment ([How to understand the overlap of long COVID, chronic fatigue ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049017224000957#:~:text=,directed%20against%20autonomic%20and)) ([How to understand the overlap of long COVID, chronic fatigue ...](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0049017224000957#:~:text=Similar%20neuroimmune%20abnormalities%20have%20been,directed%20against%20autonomic%20and)). Immunologically, some overlaps like elevated cytokines (e.g. IL-8, TNF) and reduced NK cell function have been noted. However, differences may exist too: one study found attention and processing speed deficits in both, but slightly worse in ME/CFS ([ME/CFS and Long COVID share similar symptoms and biological ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10278546/#:~:text=,49)). By performing side-by-side analyses, researchers hope to find a common biomarker signature, which could lead to a unified theory for post-infectious fatigue syndromes. This could also accelerate trials: drugs that have been tried in ME/CFS (like rituximab, which had mixed results, or emerging metabolic modulators) might be re-examined for long COVID.

- **Other Post-Infectious Syndromes:** Post-Ebola syndrome, post-Chikungunya or post-Dengue syndromes, and even post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome share elements of long COVID. Comparing patient samples from these could identify if, for instance, they all show a certain autoantibody or T-cell exhaustion profile, pointing to a generic pathway for post-infection illness. It’s possible that *persistent antigen and autoimmunity* are a final common pathway for many of these conditions. If long COVID research uncovers a treatment that works (say, a broad immunomodulator or antiviral), it might be extended to other post-viral conditions.

- **Primary Neuroinflammatory Disorders:** Long COVID brain fog and neuroinflammation can be compared to mild encephalitis or autoimmune encephalopathy. For example, cognitive profiles and CSF cytokine levels in long COVID could be juxtaposed with those in mild cognitive impairment from other causes or chronic encephalitis. If microglial markers are similar, treatments like IVIG or steroid-sparing immunosuppressants used in those disorders might be indicated for a subset of long COVID.

- **Dysautonomia/POTS from other causes:** By comparing long COVID POTS patients with classical POTS (often young women post-viral or associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome), we can see if the same autoantibodies or impaired norepinephrine clearance issues are present. If yes, therapies proven in primary POTS (like volume expansion, low-dose propranolol, IVIG for autoantibody-positive POTS) are reinforced for use in long COVID POTS. If differences exist (long COVID POTS might have more inflammatory markers, for example), that guides slightly different treatment (perhaps more anti-inflammatory therapy in addition to standard POTS treatment). Indeed, an interesting observation is that a significant fraction of long COVID patients fulfilling POTS criteria had no prior history of dysautonomia, indicating the infection as a clear precipitant; whereas primary POTS often has a more gradual onset or precipitated by other stressors. Understanding this precipitant might clarify POTS in general.

- **Aging and Neurodegeneration:** Some scientists draw parallels between long COVID and accelerated aging. Cognitive issues, exercise intolerance, and even epigenetic clocks measured in patients suggest their bodies have undergone something akin to advanced aging. If spike protein persistence causes a chronic inflammatory state, it might hasten processes like neurodegeneration. Studies have found overlaps in gene expression between brains of long COVID patients and those with Alzheimer’s disease ([Zapping the Vagus Nerve Could Relieve Some Long COVID ...](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/zapping-the-vagus-nerve-could-relieve-some-long-covid-symptoms/#:~:text=Zapping%20the%20Vagus%20Nerve%20Could,chronic%20fatigue%2C%20headaches%20and)). Does long COVID increase risk of earlier onset dementia? Longitudinal studies will tell, but if so, it elevates the urgency to intervene early. It also means therapies being developed for age-related cognitive decline (like senolytics to clear senescent cells, or neuroprotective drugs such as BDNF mimetics) could be repurposed to treat long COVID cognitive symptoms.

- **Psychiatric Overlap:** Long COVID has a psychiatric dimension, but it’s important to distinguish primary psychiatric illness from neuroinflammation-driven mood/cognitive changes. That said, the situation is analogous to conditions like *post-ICU syndrome* or *chronic concussion syndrome*, where patients have a mix of cognitive deficits, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Studying the psychological and neurological rehabilitation techniques in those conditions (for example, cognitive behavioral therapy for coping, neurorehabilitation exercises, SSRIs for depression which can also aid cognition indirectly) can inform supportive therapy in long COVID. Moreover, stigma and validation issues faced by conditions like ME/CFS offer lessons: patient advocacy and clear biomedical evidence (biomarkers, imaging as above) go a long way in legitimizing the illness, which can improve patient engagement and mental health.

**Collaborative Research Networks:** Because of these overlaps, we see collaboration across fields that were previously siloed. Long COVID research networks are including experts in autoimmunity, cardiology, neurology, virology, and even those who study chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. This cross-pollination means syndrome comparisons happen naturally. For instance, many ME/CFS researchers pivoted to study long COVID, bringing their tools (e.g., 2-day exercise test, tilt-table testing expertise, cytokine panels) directly into COVID research ([

Government and academic initiatives are explicitly linking cohorts of long COVID with existing cohorts of similar illnesses to enable direct comparisons. The hope is that solutions found for long COVID will not only help these patients but also millions who suffer from analogous post-infectious or neuroimmune conditions that have long been under-researched.

In summary, by studying long COVID not in isolation but in the context of related conditions, we accelerate understanding through analogy and provide a richer framework to interpret findings. This syndromic approach ensures we are not “reinventing the wheel” but rather building on prior knowledge, while also recognizing the novel aspects of COVID-19’s legacy. Given the sense of urgency and global impact, these comparative studies are likely to yield high-impact insights in the coming years, fundamentally enriching neuroimmunology and virology.

## **Conclusion**

The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has emerged not only as the key mediator of acute viral entry but also as a central culprit in the long-term neurological and immunological complications of COVID-19. As detailed in this paper, the spike protein’s capacity to disrupt the blood–brain barrier and incite systemic neuroimmune dysregulation places it at the nexus of long COVID pathophysiology ([

This recognition reframes long COVID from a nebulous collection of symptoms to a syndrome with a concrete biological basis: a virus-induced, spike-protein-driven neurovascular injury leading to chronic inflammation and autoimmunity.

Therapeutically, a multi-target approach is imperative. Just as combination therapy is used in HIV or cancer to tackle multi-pronged pathogenesis, long COVID demands interventions that (1) **protect and repair the BBB**, (2) **suppress pathological inflammation and autoimmunity**, (3) **restore autonomic balance**, (4) **eliminate residual virus or antigen**, and (5) **rejuvenate metabolic and neural function**. We have outlined candidates for each of these aims – from RhoA/ROCK inhibitors and MMP-9 blockers to cytokine antibodies, vagus nerve stimulators, antivirals, and metabolic supplements. Many of these therapies are available now, and some (like anti-cytokine drugs or ivabradine for POTS) are already being trialed or used off-label with reported success in subsets of patients ([NIH opens long COVID trials to evaluate treatments for autonomic nervous system dysfunction | National Institutes of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-opens-long-covid-trials-evaluate-treatments-autonomic-nervous-system-dysfunction#:~:text=The%20trials%20will%20initially%20examine,three%20potential%20treatments)) ([

The challenge ahead is determining the right combinations for the right patients at the right time, i.e. precision medicine for long COVID.

A clear consensus emerges for **urgent, coordinated action**. The burden of long COVID is enormous – by some estimates, 10–20% of survivors have lingering symptoms, translating to tens of millions worldwide. Ertürk and colleagues poignantly noted that if even a fraction of those have significant spike protein deposition in their brains with resultant cognitive decline, we face a looming public health crisis of neurodegenerative disease in younger populations ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=protein%2C%E2%80%9D%20explains%20Dr,%E2%80%9D)) ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=Globally%2C%2050%20to%2060%20percent,is%20a%20societal%20challenge%2C%E2%80%9D%20says)). In their words, “this is not just an individual health issue – it is a societal challenge” ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=It%20might%20be%20%E2%80%9Cnot%20just,view%20of%20the%20new%20findings)) ([Long COVID: Spike Protein Accumulation Linked to Long-L … - LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/newsroom/news-overview/news/long-covid-spike-protein-accumulation-linked-to-long-lasting-brain-effects.html#:~:text=Globally%2C%2050%20to%2060%20percent,is%20a%20societal%20challenge%2C%E2%80%9D%20says)). Tackling this challenge requires breaking silos between specialties and between research and clinical practice. 

Multidisciplinary care models should be widely implemented and supported by healthcare systems. Governments and institutions need to fund integrated long COVID clinics and research hubs where neurologists, immunologists, cardiologists, rehabilitation specialists, and others work side by side. Such centers will not only provide comprehensive patient care but will also serve as living laboratories to study the illness and rapidly disseminate findings. The allocation of $1 billion by the U.S. NIH for long COVID research (RECOVER initiative) and similar commitments by other countries is a crucial start, but these funds must support collaboration and longitudinal studies that capture the dynamic nature of the syndrome.

Coordination is also needed at the **policy and public health level**. Long COVID sufferers require social support, workplace accommodation, and sometimes long-term disability resources. Health policy advocates, armed with the kind of biomedical evidence discussed in this paper, should lobby for recognition of long COVID as a potentially disabling condition with specific guidelines for management and compensation. For example, policies could mandate insurance coverage for post-COVID rehabilitation programs or emerging therapies, given the strong rationale and increasing evidence base.

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted unprecedented scientific mobilization to develop vaccines and acute therapies in record time. We must now apply a similar urgency to the pandemic’s chronic aftermath. Every piece of insight – be it a biomarker, an imaging finding, or a trial result – should be rapidly shared and translated into practice. Clinical trials for long COVID interventions (many of which we have highlighted, such as ROCK inhibitors, IVIG, antivirals, VNS, etc.) should be prioritized by regulatory agencies, with streamlined approvals for promising approaches.

In conclusion, viewing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a long-term **“neuroimmune disruptor”** provides a unifying framework that links virology with neurology and immunology. It compels us to intervene on multiple fronts: sealing the blood–brain barrier, reining in rampant immunity, retraining the autonomic nervous system, and nurturing the brain back to health. The sense of urgency cannot be overstated – each day, patients languish with debilitating symptoms, and the prospect of irreversible damage (like brain atrophy or autoimmune organ injury) looms. But there is also **hope**. The remarkable neuroplasticity of the brain and the evolving resilience of the immune system mean that with timely and appropriate interventions, recovery is attainable. Cases of patients who have returned to near-normal function with comprehensive care are proof of concept. 

The road ahead will require **global coordination**, as the impact of long COVID respects no borders. By sharing data and strategies internationally – much as was done for acute COVID – we can accelerate finding what works. And importantly, the legacy of these efforts will extend beyond COVID: the knowledge gained will illuminate other baffling chronic conditions and improve our general approach to post-infectious diseases.

Humanity has witnessed the acute devastation of COVID-19; we are now coming to grasp its chronic shadow. It is our responsibility to act swiftly and smartly to dispel that shadow. By countering the spike protein’s insidious effects through science-driven therapy and compassionate, integrated care, we can restore health to millions and prevent a protracted secondary pandemic of neurological and immune illness. The convergence of clinical acumen, research innovation, and policy support envisioned in this paper charts a path forward – one of urgent hope and resolute action against this long-term disruptor.
