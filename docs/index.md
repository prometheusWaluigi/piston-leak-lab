# Piston Leak Lab

> *Symbolic dynamical‑systems analysis of institutional narrative collapse.*

## Project Overview

**Piston Leak Lab (PLL)** investigates how tightly coupled institutional stories fracture under semantic overload—using COVID‑19 as the canonical case. The project combines formal dynamical systems modeling with symbolic narrative analysis, creating a powerful framework for understanding institutional epistemic failure.

## Core Concepts

Our research demonstrates that narrative collapse is not primarily a phenomenon of individual credibility, but rather emerges from systemic properties of coupled narrative networks when under sufficient strain.

### The T-N-P Framework

The core of our model tracks three macro-variables:

* **Trust (T)** - Average edge weight from public to institution
* **Narrative Entropy (N)** - System Shannon entropy  
* **Suppression Pressure (P)** - Cumulative effort expended on message control

These variables interact through coupled differential equations, creating a dynamical system with multiple attractors and potential phase transitions.

### Attractor Modes

We identify five key modes of attractor fracture:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **FCC** | *Fractured Character Continuity* - A single node is assigned mutually exclusive epistemic roles |
| **CCD** | *Causal Chain Discontinuity* - Chronological contradictions inject temporal curvature |
| **SDMM** | *Semantic Doubling & Memetic Mirrorplay* - Rapid re-signification of key terms |
| **RSD** | *Recursive Suppression Disclosure* - Attempted narrative gating becomes evidence for the gated claim |
| **MST** | *Myth of the Single Timeline* - Incompatible origin stories coexist |

> **Narrative Joke:** Why did Dr. Fauci's narrative need a mechanic? Too many leaky pistons under pressure! The mechanic's diagnosis: "Severe epistemic rod knock with catastrophic truth-gasket failure."
