"""
Piston Leak Lab Test Fixer
==========================

This script fixes critical test failures in the Piston Leak Lab codebase:
1. Trust variable escaping [0,1] bounds in ODE simulation
2. ABM belief distribution not summing to 1.0
3. Various linting issues across the codebase

Run this script to apply all the fixes at once.
