Institutional‑Failure Roast License 1.0

then sprinkled with industrial‑strength satire)

PREAMBLE
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

You are free to **share**, **adapt**, **remix**, and **re‑enact dramatic readings**
of this Work (code, papers, ducks, et al.) for any purpose—even
commercial—so long as you follow the roast‑conditions below.
We want curiosity to spread faster than spike proteins at a funding review
meeting, but honesty matters, too.

ROAST‑CONDITIONS
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

1. **Attribution — Credit & Crudités**  
   Give appropriate credit, link to this repo, and note that “institutional
   narrative control failed harder than a Zoom press conference with the mute
   button stuck on.”  You may do so in any reasonable manner, but **not** in
   a way that suggests we (the Authors) endorse your lab, think‑tank, or
   edgy YouTube channel.

2. **Share Alike — Fork It Forward**  
   If you remix, transform, or build upon the Work, you must distribute your
   contributions under this same license—or one that is even freer and just
   as spicy.  Gatekeeping is for antibody‑dependent enhancement, not ideas.

3. **No Retroactive Gaslighting**  
   You may not claim that nobody could’ve predicted spike‑induced
   neurotoxicity, lab‑safety fumbles, or the epistemic meltdown of 2020‑22.
   We **did**; the commit history proves it.  Delete‑history PRs will be
   publicly shamed in the changelog.

4. **Comedy Non‑Dilution Clause**  
   Any formal institutional derivative (e.g., white‑label training deck,
   health‑agency slide stack) must preserve at least **one joke** per
   ten pages.  The world already has enough humorless slideware.

HOW TO COMPLY (THE TL;DR)
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

- **Link back** ➜ put the repo URL somewhere visible.  
- **Keep it free** ➜ derivatives stay open & equally snarky.  
- **Don’t rewrite history** ➜ receipts live forever.  
- **Keep a joke** ➜ memes > memos.
